Web frontend for controlling mplayer on another server

I've got a Raspberry Pi hooked up to my house's sound system. I've mounted my
music collection on the Pi, and built a playlist. I use mplayer to play the
playlist, but wanted a way to easily control the volume and current track
remotely so I wouldn't have to walk to the master closet to fiddle with a knob
or to my office to mess with the CLI.

Mounting music on the Pi

Use sshfs. I've got ssh keys set up so that running:
    pi@master$ sshfs media-server:/home/music music
will mount /home/music on the machine named media-server on the Pi's home
directory in a new directory called music.

Creating a named pipe to control mplayer

The media player is controlled through a named pipe, which you'll have to
create.
    pi@master$ mkfifo ~/mplayer-control

Starting mplayer

    pi@master$ cd music ; mplayer -quiet -slave -input file=~/mplayer-control -shuffle -playlist party.m3u
